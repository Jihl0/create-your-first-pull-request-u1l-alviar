I look forward to learning this semester, particularly in CMSC 100.

One of those that I eagerly look forward to is that I'll be able to revisit HTML and CSS. Additionally, I would be able to deepen my knowledge of Javascript and its technologies.

Another expectation I have for this course is that I would be able to grasp how websites work such as how Facebook is made.

Also, I would like to learn in this course the ability to manipulate components of a website by what I imagine it to do.
